# Day 11
A Day 11 update from my Coding Journey!

One of the assignments we had to complete in class today was creating a flag using HTML and CSS. The instructor encouraged us to attempt basic flags, like the flags for Ireland or Japan.

As I was working on the assignment (I had selected the French flag), the instructor added that few students had attempted the American flag, and if they had, it had proven to be too difficult of a challenge.

My ears perked up.

...I am incredibly competitive.

So I quickly wrapped up my French flag and got to work on the American flag. After an hour attempting to hack it myself with few results, I turned to the internet and found the following site: https://lnkd.in/dNJ7df-M

Following along, I took inspiration from Codinhood's code and began to incorporate their solutions to my failures. Like a seamstress, I stitched together a Frankenstein of HTML and CSS, inching closer and closer to an accurate depiction of the American flag.

After hours of hitting a new wall, and unable to move my stripes behind my blue box, I reached out to a friend for help. We hopped into Discord and we began going through each line of code, making tiny adjustments, and correcting errors.

Finally, after four hours of pain-staking work, we had an American flag! I had done it, but not without a lot of help.

I hope it gets easier, or maybe my coding skills can improve enough to manage such a challenge without these crutches. For now, I'll take my wins where I can and call it a learning experience. :)
