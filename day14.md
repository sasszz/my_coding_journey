# Day 14
A Day 14 update from my Coding Journey!

âœ… The end of my third week with Coding Dojo.

âœ… The end of my first week in-person at the Burbank campus.

I am blown away at my progress in just a few short weeks. Our final core assignment this week was using HTML and CSS to re-create (from scratch!) a Social Media web page from a reference they provided.

I submitted my assignment per the requirements and then took some creative liberties on a second version. ðŸ˜…

What won't be shown in the screen-recording demo or the code I write is the adjacent knowledge needed to accomplish these projects. This would include skills like how to open a file in VS Code, how to create a directory in the terminal, how to create a Git folder and sync to Github, how to troubleshoot, and even how to ask for help. The pixels on the screen only display 10% of the achievements I am making during bootcamp.

I was happy to end the week on a high note. Now, I look forward to the weekend to catch up on some assignments and sleep!

The truth is, I am on a run-away train to my graduation date of October 21st. Time to buckle-up and hold on for dear life!
