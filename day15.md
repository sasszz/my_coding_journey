# Day 15
A Day 15 update from my Coding Journey!

Being in a bootcamp is more than a full time job. 

It’s similar to having a full-time day job and working nights and weekends at a part-time job. Morning, afternoon and nights, I have my laptop open and I’m tapping away. Weekend? Who is she?

So how do avoid feeling overwhelmed in a bootcamp? To a degree, the pace makes this feeling inescapable but there’s ways I’ve found to manage it. I make assignments creative and relevant to my interests. I put on a Twitch stream or a show while doing homework. I hang out in a Discord call with a friend while I finish a project.

When I made these adjustments to my study-habits, all of a sudden coding didn’t feel like a chore; I am excited to pick up where I last left off.

Excitement is critical to absorbing the material I am learning. I cannot “force” myself into learning. I cannot “suffer” through the material. Iff this is something I want to do as part of a career, I need to learn how to enjoy the process and the hours I put into it.

The screen-recording I included today was an assignment that I enjoyed quite a bit. I took creative liberties, I included additional functionality, and I re-visited the code multiple times over the span of a few days.

This is the visual result of approaching something with love, patience and care. I hope you enjoy. :)
