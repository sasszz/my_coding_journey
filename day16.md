# Day 16
A Day 16 update from my Coding Journey!

Tomorrow is our Belt Exam for Web Fundamentals, and what will mark the end of our first stack.

We'll be tested on our ability to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to code an interactive web page. I feel reassured because we've been building web pages all week!

Our last assignment for Web Fundamentals was building a Weather Website with the following features:
➡️ Change degrees from Celsius to Fahrenheit
➡️ Make the cookie box disappear when the "I accept" button is clicked

Of course I had to add some hover functionality and a cute font ;)

Let's get after it!
