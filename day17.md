# Day 17
I PASSED MY FIRST >mini< STACK of WEB FUNDAMENTALS! ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³

On Day 0, I was an unemployed customer service agent. On Day 1, I printed "Hello World" in my console. On Day 17, I built a web page from a wireframe in 3 hours.

This wouldn't be possible without my amazing community of supporters, classmates, instructors and bootcamp staff. Here's to the power of community and getting it done! ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³
