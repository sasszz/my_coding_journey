# Day 20
A Day 20 update from my Coding Journey!

Thank you to everyone to has been following along so far and supporting me with your likes, comments and words of encouragement! Only 20 classroom days in bootcamp and the progress is unreal! 🤯

A quick recap:

On June 13th, I had a normal Monday at work as a Customer Service Agent for Coinbase.

On June 14th, I found myself with tears in my eyes being consoled by close friends and coworkers after discovering I was let-go from my position.

On June 16th, I signed my enrollment agreement with Coding Dojo to attend their 3-Stack Coding Bootcamp.

On July 5th, I had my first day in bootcamp and I learned how to code using Javascript (or any language for that matter) for the very first time.

On Day 20, August 1st, I now present to you one of my crowning achievements in bootcamp so far. It is a collaborative project posted on GitHub that will randomly generate a pizza (which also includes original art by myself!).
