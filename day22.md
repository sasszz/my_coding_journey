# Day 22
A Day 22 update from my Coding Journey!

GitHub.

The social media of programmers? One could say so. My instructors would remind me that it's also a source of truth for code and projects, and an important tool in a developer's tool belt.

Today I wanted to share the other side of my coding journey - the part that will hopefully get me into a position by the time I graduate in October:

It's resume workshops; it's interview practice; it's meeting with my Career Services manager; it's updating LinkedIn; it's making daily commits to Github; it's drafting ReadMe files. It's a side of becoming a developer that feels about as tedious as reading this paragraph!

Like always, in order to get it done, you have to make it fun!

Welcome to my Github page, decorated with my very own pixel art gifs and easter eggs. I hope you can pay a visit sometime!

P.S. Sending much love to those on the hunt for work <3 WAGMI!
