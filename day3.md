# Day 3
A Day 3 update from my Coding Journey!

I was having trouble understanding conditionals (which allow code to be executed under certain conditions by using If/Else If/Else statements), so I went to Youtube for some extra practice. I found a helpful video from a Youtuber named Alex Lee: https://lnkd.in/eDx2FmRX

The issue I discovered was that he was writing his code in Java whereas I have only been learning Javascript. As I was following along with his video in my .js file, I was returning a ton of errors that I was unable to resolve. 

So I got to work, and started removing some code I couldn’t resolve errors for and adjusting other code to match the syntax I had been learning for Javascript. I also had to scrap some of the functionality that Alex described in the video (such as allowing a user to enter in a number). 

By the end, I had a fully functional If/Else If/Else statement where I could enter a number 1-100, and my console would display an associated letter grade! If I entered a number outside of this range, I would receive an error (that I had coded into the conditional statement) declaring that I had entered an invalid number.

It was a surreal moment to conquer a topic I was having issues with and also have a functional piece of code. I have always been intimidated by coding, but I’m starting to realize that coding is a combination of creative problem solving, and iterating the work of others. 

If you have a moment, check out Alex Lee’s Youtube channel! And if you have another moment, check out the video demonstration of the code I made! We're taking small steps, but at least the journey is beginning. #codingbootcamp #womenwhocode #coinbase18 #javascript
