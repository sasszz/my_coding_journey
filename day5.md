# Day 5
A Day 5 update from my Coding Journey!

Today we learned HTML and I had so much fun expressing my creativity and personality in a web page!

As part of our HTML assignment, we had to create a table, use two different headers, insert a clickable link, and create a form.

You'll see in the screen-recording below that I also included some gifs I made using Procreate on my iPad, as well as tons of emojis.

It was a great start to our second week of coding bootcamp!
