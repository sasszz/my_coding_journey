# Day 7
A Day 7 update from my Coding Journey!

The power of teamwork 💪

I had been stuck on a CSS assignment and was unable to get a blue block aligned with a red block. I tried tinkering with my code, changing margins or adding in CSS snippets from forums, but I was unable to fix the issue myself.

For context, in our program, we've been taught the 20 minute rule when it comes to getting un-stuck:
➡️ Spend 20 mins reviewing the chapter's content, or checking the internet.
➡️ Spend 20 mins with a cohort-mate or two to see if they can help.
➡️ Lastly, reach out to the instructor to see if they can help.

After exhausting the resources I had in the chapter and online, I turned to our Discord channel and posted for help. Luckily, at 10pm PST, someone replied! They gave me the one line I needed (vertical-align: top;) and even explained how they came to that finding and why it works.

I have been honored with a supportive cohort where we build each other up! I guess somewhere we realize we're facing an uphill battle switching careers, and we're going to need all the help and support we can get.

With the team I have, I believe we can do it! 💪
